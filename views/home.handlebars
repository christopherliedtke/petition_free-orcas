    <h1>Free <span class="text-dark text-shadow-light">ORCAS</span></h1>
    <h2>from the swimming pool</h2>

    <p>Orcas, also known as killer whales, have been kept in captivity since 1961. They are the defenceless victims of a cruel industry that is responsible for dozens of free-ranging orcas being snatched from their families and condemned to a life in artificially assembled groups that has nothing to do with their former lifes.</p>
    <p>Orcas are known to have a great emotional intelligence &ndash; probably even higher than humans &ndash; are living in their own tribes for all their life of which each of them speaks their own unique language. Putting these creatures in a small swimming pool to entertain us is just a shame for humanity.</p>

    <h3>LET'S STOP THIS CRUELTY!</h3>
